# mini-eLiXiVy
 Repository of my project mini-eLiXiVy, which previously had the working title of 'mini-65'. 
 This is a 65% mechanical keyboard PCB with a rotary encoder option, compatible with the KBDFans 65% plate and low profile case.

 The PCB and schematic are licensed under CERN-OHL-S v2, the full license of this project can be found here: https://github.com/minibois/eLiXiVy/blob/master/Documents/LICENSE.txt

 This PCB supports a couple different 65% layouts, including a regular or stepped caps lock, ISO Enter (and 1.75u left Shift + 1u \ keys or a 2.75u left Shift), three 1u or two 1.25u modifiers between the spacebar and arrow key. See the below image for all officially supported layouts:

 In the top right of the keyboard you can either use an MX-like keyswitch or rotary encoder with switch (see the BOM for a verified compatible option).
 
 Bill of materials:
 https://octopart.com/bom-tool/allQRgda

 The bill of materials lists the tested compatible components. Substitutes may be available, should these materials be difficult or otherwise not possible to obtain (i.e. while a capacitor from one manufacturer may be specifically listed, an equal sized and value capacitor may be a suitable alternative. Although I can only vouch compatibility for the listed components).
