# mini-eLiXiVy
 Repository of my project mini-eLiXiVy, which previously had the working title of 'mini-65'. 
 This is a 65% mechanical keyboard PCB with a rotary encoder option, compatible with the KBDFans 65% plate and low profile case.

 The PCB and schematic are licensed under CERN-OHL-S v2, the full license of this project can be found here: https://github.com/minibois/eLiXiVy/blob/master/LICENSE.txt

 This PCB supports a couple different 65% layouts, including a regular or stepped caps lock, ISO Enter (and 1.75u left Shift + 1u \ keys or a 2.75u left Shift), three 1u or two 1.25u modifiers between the spacebar and arrow key. See the below image for all officially supported layouts:

 The top right piece of the keyboard can either support an MX-like keyswitch or rotary encoder with switch (see the BOM for a verified compatible option).

 The bill of materials (BOM: TODO: add link) lists the tested compatible components, but substitutes may be available, should these materials be difficult or otherwise not possible to obtain (i.e. while a capacitor from one manufacturer may be specifically listed, an equal sized and value capacitor may be a suitable alternative, although I can vouch compatibility for the listed components).

 Not listed in the BOM are:
 - Tools needed to assemble the PCB (I assembled this using a soldering iron and general tools and soldering supplies)
 - General keyboard components (with the plethora of options in switches/stabilizers/lubes/etc. everyone will have their preference)
