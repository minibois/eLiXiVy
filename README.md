# mini-eLiXiVy
#### Repository of my project mini-eLiXiVy (previously had the working title of 'mini-65'), which is a 65% mechanical keyboard PCB, compatible with ANSI and ISO headers and with the possibility to use a tactile rotary encoder.
 This PCB is compatible with KBDFans' 65% low profile case/plate and Cherry MX(-like) keyswitches.

### The compatible layouts for this PCB are as follows:

 In the top right of the keyboard you can either use an MX-like keyswitch or rotary encoder with switch (see the BOM for a verified compatible option).
 Bill of materials: https://octopart.com/bom-tool/allQRgda (see ../Documents for a .txt and .xlsx version of the BOM).

 While the the bill of materials mentioned tested compatible components, substitutes may be available, should these components become difficult to obtain. I can only vouch for the compability of the listed components.
